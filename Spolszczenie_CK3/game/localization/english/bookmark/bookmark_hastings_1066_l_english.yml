Now, elected the new King of England by his peers, he is faced with the challenge of holding onto the throne, as the covetous Duke of Normandy, as well as King Harald of Norway, spurred on and aided by Harold's exiled brother, seek to replace him!\n\n#bold With a large army at your back and the support of the Anglo-Saxon lords — will the wolves find that they have bitten off more than they can chew?#!"

But, instead, the Anglo-Saxons have put Harold Godwinson on the throne! Luckily, the false King has made enemies, and Tostig Godwinson, Harold's own brother, lives in exile in Norway...\n\n#bold By using his own enemies against him, can you give this Varangian viking control over the North Sea?#!"
