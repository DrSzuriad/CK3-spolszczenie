 bm_867_iberia_desc: "The old powers of Iberia are breaking.\n\nIn the north, Asturias is rife with ambitious vassals, straining to be free.\n\nIn the south, al-Andalus waxes strong but faces rumblings of discontent. The border military districts mutter about independence and intrigue plagues the ruling Umayyads.\n\nHungry foreign powers eye Iberia's rich lands covetously.\n\n#bold Centuries in the making, the $game_concept_iberian_struggle$ enters a new phase, and whether it ends in blood or brotherhood lies on a roll of the dice."

Hard times have befallen them since the reign of $Lubb$'s glorious father, though, and the newly-renamed Banu Musa merely mutter and lick their wounds from their ancient seat at Tudela, plotting to recover their southern dominions.\n\n#bold Will you be able to retake what once belonged to the Banu Qasi and bring the dynasty back to its former glory?#!"

He has carved out a stronghold in Badajoz, but in the west, the zealous Banu Danis clan grows ever more opposed to his rule over the Lower March.\n\n#bold Might an alliance with Alfonso III, Asturias' ever-opportunistic king, help you gain a crown of your own?#"
