Stooping to pick it up, I unearth a bone-white, hard, circular item: a scallop shell.\n\nSuch shells are a mark of the pilgrims that travel this road on the path towards Santiago, and anyone who possesses one — especially one with the mark of Santiago printed on it — has completed the arduous journey.\n\nI turn the shell over in my hand covetously, aware of the disapproving gaze of [realm_priest.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] boring into the back of my skull."
