 hunt.7001.desc: "As we ride deep into the [activity_place.GetName] the ground grows wetter and the air grows heavier. Suddenly, from out of the greenery surrounding us, a giant of a man appears — hulking in layer upon layer of dirty clothing.\n\n\"Explain yourself!\" He shouts, \"What are you doing in #EMP my#! marshland?\""

 hunt.8001.desc: "As we return from [activity_place.GetName] with the felled [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimal')] in tow, I cannot help but to admire it even in death. Such a fine specimen – I could easily envision its hide or skull decorating the walls of my court! Oh, but which option to pick?"
 hunt.8001.a: "The lush pelt of the animal will be an excellent conversation piece."
 hunt.8001.b: "Mounting the head of the [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimal')] show my guests its majesty."

 hunt.9001.desc_hunter_3: "No matter how fast, strong, or cunning the quarry, it stands no chance against me! My prowess as a hunter is the topic of many conversations across the realm. However, the true reward is the freedom that the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TerrainType')] grant me."
