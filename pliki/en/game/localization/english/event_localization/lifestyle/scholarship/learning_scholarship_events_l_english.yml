However, it is possible that this reaction is one of the fabled '12 vital processes' needed to create gold!"
 learning_scholarship_special.3005.a: "Am I one step closer to true transmutation?"
 learning_scholarship_special.3006.desc: "Upon mixing the lead sugar into the boiled seaweed ash the mixture suddenly turned a vibrant yellow.\n\nWhile I did not manage to produce actual gold, I did find that my solution can be used as a dye which rivals saffron in brilliance.
