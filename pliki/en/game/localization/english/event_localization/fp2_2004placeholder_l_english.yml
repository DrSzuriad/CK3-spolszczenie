[2004_scoped_steward.GetSheHe|U] says that with funding, we could have a new ship designed that would outperform our neighbors and usher in an era of maritime supremacy for [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip].\n\nOn the other hand, my [2004_scoped_marshal.GetCouncilTitleFirstName], would much rather spend that gold in things other than trade vessels."
